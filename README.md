# BEPEC-ML-project--Customer-Churn-Prediction


 # **Project Objectives**

•	Goal: Develop a Next Best Action (NBA) model to identify potential churn customers and recommend personalized actions to retain them.

•	Use Case: Predict customer churn based on transaction history, demographic data, and account activity, and suggest targeted actions to increase customer retention.

# **Tools Used**

•	Programming Language: Python

•	Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, OpenPyXL

•	Machine Learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

•	Preprocessing Techniques: Label Encoding, Handling Missing Values, Feature Scaling

•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

 # **Responsibilities**

•	Imported the dataset using Pandas and handled missing values and anomalies in income and gender fields.

•   Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations, including box plots to detect outliers and heatmaps for correlation 
      analysis.
      
•   Label Encoded categorical variables like "Gender" and "Marital Status".

•	Applied StandardScaler for scaling numerical features.

•	Used train_test_split to divide the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

•	Trained models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

•	Evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC, and analyzed classification reports to compare models.

•	Selected Random Forest for its superior recall in identifying churn customers.

•	Generated actionable insights from the model results, suggesting strategies to reduce churn through personalized customer outreach.
